        I studied engineering for four years at{" "}
        <strong>Divine Word College of Calapan</strong> in the{" "}
        <strong>Philippines</strong>, where I earned a{" "}
        <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering</strong>. When I was
        a student, I had my first experience with programming and learned how to
        use Python and C#. But it was in my third year that I first developed an
        interest in web programming. I found what the developers were doing to
        be intriguing, so I began my journey in the hope that one day I would be
        able to do it too.
