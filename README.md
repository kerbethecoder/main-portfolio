## Experience

**Digital Payment System**  
 _Thesis Project_  
 January 2023 - April 2023  
 &nbsp;With a team, we work on a project for our thesis that attempts to create a payment system for the school using various technologies, such as VueJs, NestJs, Docker, PostgreSQL, Postman, etc. The objective of the project is to create a real-time payment system for the school that can be used online or through a kiosk device that we also created for within the school.

**On-the-Job Training**  
 _Bookbrush_  
 June 2022 - August 2022  
 &nbsp;Working with two senior developers, I went through mini-tasks they gave me, such as reducing a complex code block to a brief one, and other front-end development-related work. Throughout the course of the job, I also get more knowledge about git version control. I also got a taste of what back-end development is all about and came across PHP, but I didn't stick around in that assignment for very long because of the intricate code used by the company. On the other hand, I now understand what developers do within a corporation, including but not limited to the necessary daily standup meetings.

**Videographer & Video Editor**  
 _Digital Campaign Team_  
 August 2021 - October 2021  
 &nbsp;During this time, I had firsthand experience working in a collaborative office setting on a team. Even though it has little to do with coding, I think it gave me insight into a company-related environment. It also in some way strengthened my perspective on creativity, which is important in front-end programming because it takes both to make stunning and user-friendly web content.

**Basic Retail Inventory System**  
 _BSCpE Project_  
 May 2021 - June 2021  
 &nbsp;Working on a retail inventory system for a store was assigned as a pair task. We use Visual Basic for coding using SQL and C#. The project’s objective is to teach us students how to build an inventory system for a specific store with CRUD functionality.
